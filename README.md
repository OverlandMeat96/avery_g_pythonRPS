# Rock Paper Scissors - Python text-based take on a classic!
## Pick your weapon and play against the computer - you'll only get a virtual sting if you lose!

## Requirements
The only requirement to play this game is that [python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is installed on your system. 

Not a lot - you'll need git installed localy, as well as a preprocessor like [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) for CSS compilation. A good code editor helps too!

## Installation, etc
CD to the location of your choice, and then git clone. Run the game.py file in a Python3 Terminal window for Mac / Linux, or the powershell for Windows.

## Rules 
The rules are the same as the classic game:
1. Paper covers Rock
2. Scissors cuts Paper
3. Rock smashes Scissors

*Chose your weapon wisely!*

Enjoy!
