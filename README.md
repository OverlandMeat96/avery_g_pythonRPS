# Rock Paper Scissors - Python text-based take on a classic!
## Pick your weapon and play against the computer - you'll only get a virtual sting if you lose!

## Requirements
The only requirement to play this game is that [python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is installed on your system. 

## Installation, etc
Clone the project, navigate to the correct directory - `cd directory name` - and rin the `game.py` file in a Python 2 Terminal window for macOS / Linux. For windows, simply install pythin 3 then click on the `game.py` file to play. 

## Rules 
The rules are the same as the classic game:
1. Paper covers Rock
2. Scissors cuts Paper
3. Rock smashes Scissors

*Chose your weapon wisely!*

The computer chooses first; just follow the prompts.

Enjoy!
